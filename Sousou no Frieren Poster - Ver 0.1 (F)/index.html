                        The demon king has been defeated, and the victorious hero party returns home before disbanding. The four—mage Frieren, 
                        hero Himmel, priest Heiter, and warrior Eisen—reminisce about their decade-long journey as the moment to bid each 
                        other farewell arrives. But the passing of time is different for elves, thus Frieren witnesses her companions slowly 
                        pass away one by one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before his death, Heiter manages to foist a young human apprentice called Fern onto Frieren. Driven by the elf's 
                        passion for collecting a myriad of magic spells, the pair embarks on a seemingly aimless journey, revisiting the 
                        places that the heroes of yore had visited. Along their travels, Frieren slowly confronts her regrets of missed 
                        opportunities to form deeper bonds with her now-deceased comrades.
